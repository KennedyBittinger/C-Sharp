Welcome to my project repository! I upload `.zip` files that contain the full project structure and resources, including:

- C# source files (`.cs`)
- Visual Studio project file (`.csproj`)
- Designer files (`.designer.cs`)
- Resource files (`.resx`)
- Project properties (`Properties/`)
- Visual Studio solution file (`.sln`)
- Visual output (images, graphs, etc.)
  
All code is developed using **Visual Studio**. Each `.zip` file contains all necessary components to explore, build, and run the project.

Download raw file in order to view.
